Seeking work experience/internship - remote and part-time.

Small projects, research projects etc...

I love information systems and am keen on developing my skills in the DATA layer with a focus on wiring together many different data sources and technologies. I have worked with MySQL, MongoDB and Google Firestore.

I use REACT for the UI. I am a fan of the REACT/REDUX architecture to separate concerns and have also worked with MobX as a state management system.

## Learning

Whilst technology skills are what I need to leanr, the real learning is *mindset*...the ability to be persistent, deal with frustration and have courage to embrace the learning curve of new technologies. The 'WALL' to progresshas been frequent. It has become an old friend/teacher rather than a bitter enemy.

Community learning, (self-taught), using YouTube, Udemy and FrontendMasters. 

Kyle Simpson and Will Sentance have been particularly helpful to me in learning JavaScript deeply, (ongoing!).

Traversy Media, Net Ninja and Steve Grifith have been my core YoutTube mentors.
