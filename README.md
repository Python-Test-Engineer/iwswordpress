## SEEKING

I am NOT looking for a job. I am looking to create value in a business rather than endless studying.

With previous careers as an accountant, business owner, Tech Architect and sales, there may be a role other than coder that uses these different skills.

I love business and the process of creating value for customers.

I also love teaching technologies, striving to make the complex understandable.

Open to ideas...

## Current Learning

Currently working with Ionic/React/Capacitor to create apps that work on all platforms with just(!) HTML/CSS/JS - 'write once, run anywhere'.

Whilst technology skills are what I need to learn, the real learning is *mindset*...the ability to be persistent, deal with frustration and have the courage to embrace the learning curve of new technologies. The 'WALL' to progress has been frequent. It has become an old friend/teacher rather than a bitter enemy.

Community learning, (self-taught), using YouTube, Udemy and FrontendMasters. 

Kyle Simpson and Will Sentance have been particularly helpful to me in learning JavaScript deeply, (ongoing!).

Traversy Media, Net Ninja and Steve Grifith have been my core YouTube mentors.
