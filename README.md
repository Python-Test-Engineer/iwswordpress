# Test Automation Engineer using Cypress and Behaviour Driven Development

# WordPress (Blocks and FSE custom development )and JavaScript/React Developer.

I am a Cypress Test Automation Engineer, living in Brighton, UK.

Originally starting with WordPress and moving to the world of JS frameworks, I found that Cypress delivered on its mission: to make testing accessible for developers.

Along with Cypress, I have used my experience with Performance Testing and Accessibility Testing to create a suite of testing skills.

With a degree in Chemistry, (Chemical Analysis), experience and qualifications as an Accountant Technician, Certification and career as an SQL Server DBA and experience as a developer, testing was bound to be appealing to me.

GitHub with its Actions, Projects and Issues will become a one stop shop for developer teams. I believe this is where teams will work and I have worked on developing deep understanding of Git as well as becoming what I call a 'GitHub Administrator', extending from repo permissions to CI/CD. I also work with GitLab CI/CD and Docker.

As a former Microsoft Certified DBA (SQL 2000), I have a strong interest in data integrity as well as using browser storage (IndexedDB) for robust and fast data retrieval.

I originally trained as an Accountant Technician, working freelance for a range of SMEs. This enables me to speak both business and development, bridging the gap between these two worlds, leading to a role as a Business Information Architect for a nationwide recycling company.

As I enjoy researching and learning new technologies, I am also available to do this in my own time prior to some project work, or given some lead time, learn what is necessary for various projects. For me, being a good developer is about being willing to learn, being able to ask for help and incredibly persistent!
